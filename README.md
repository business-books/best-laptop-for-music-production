If you're a DJ or looking for the best laptop for recording music, then you've come to the right place as we've rounded up the best laptops for making music. For music recording, you're looking for a machine with plenty of processing power and RAM to handle multiple music tracks. A large and fast hard drive or SSD (Solid State Drive) is also necessary as you are going to be working with large file sizes. Excellent speakers, or at least the ability to connect to external speakers, are also important.

If you're a DJ then you'll need something durable so it can take the occasional bump as you travel from gig to gig. Since you are going to be traveling a lot, a laptop that is thin and light will be preferred over other devices. The best laptop for DJs will also have a large hard drive or SSD to store all of your tracks. At the moment, the choice is large and while Apple products are the main choice for music makers, there are many great Windows laptops available for DJs and music production.

## Apple MacBook laptop for music production

The new Apple Macbook is the thinnest, lightest and most beautiful Macbook Apple has ever made and is one of the most popular and best-selling laptops on the planet.

Along with great music production software available for Mac, this is the best laptop for DJing and recording music. It's a super thin and light Macbook that you can take with you everywhere without even noticing its weight.

## Apple Macbook Pro laptop for music production

This is the best laptop Apple has ever made and brings new features to a classic design. Of course, the most important feature is the touchpad and the thin OLED display at the top of the keyboard, which can be used for any number of operations.

The Macbook Pro also offers more options than the Macbook, which means if you're a music producer, this is the best laptop for you as it handles complex productions across multiple audio tracks with ease.

There are cheaper alternatives to this best laptop for DJing and music production, but if speed and quality are the most important factors, then we recommend choosing the Macbook Pro.

## Surface Pro laptop for music production

The Microsoft Surface Pro is the best laptop for you if you're looking for the perfect balance between a nimble Windows tablet and a full-featured laptop.

The base Surface Pro is just a tablet and you get the main unit with a stand, and if you want the Surface Pen or the fantastic Type Cover keyboard, you'll need to pay extra for the kit or buy it separately.

Again, this is a great laptop for writers who can use the stylus to jot down their notes to later turn them into editable text.

Since the Surface Pro is a 2-in-1 tablet that runs the full version of Windows 10, this means it's an extremely portable device that can run any of the music mixing and editing programs available for Windows.

## Dell XPS 13 for music production

For several years now, the Dell XPS 13 has been one of the best laptops you can buy today. For aspiring music producers, the XPS upgrade to an 8th Gen Intel Kaby Lake R processor should be attractive as it cuts down on time spent processing tracks, allowing you to minimize downtime.

Unfortunately, you won't be able to use the 1TB drive anymore, but when you get a laptop as fast as this one and good for booting, it's a worthy trade-off.

## Lenovo Yoga laptop for music production

As with all Lenovo Yoga devices, the screen is foldable so you can use it either as a tablet or a laptop.

To add more versatility, Lenovo has now added the option to buy it with either Windows 10 or Android 6.0 included, and which you choose depends on how you plan to use the device. The screen on this device defies the cheap price, and the capacitive touch keyboard is fantastic too.

While it's a little underpowered for music production, if you're a DJ looking for the best portable laptop for music playback and mixing, it's a great choice nonetheless.

##  Apple Macbook Air: best laptop for music production

The Macbook Air is in an interesting position. While it still remains one of the most popular and well-known laptops, the iPad Pro and 12-inch MacBook have stolen much of its glory.

That is, if you don't need legacy USB 3, Thunderbolt 2, and SDXC connections, and without a Retina display or Force Touch trackpad, the 13-inch MacBook Air is a very capable machine, even if 4GB of RAM and 128GB of internal storage leave something to be desired. the best.
